# Resume-Screening-App
Overview of the project: The "Resume Category Prediction App" is an automated tool designed to predict the professional category of a person based on their resume (e.g., Software Development, Marketing, Finance, Engineering, Healthcare).

How the App Works Input: Users upload their resumes in PDF, Word, or Text format. Processing: Extract key details from the resume (e.g., skills, work experience, education). Preprocess the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization and lemmatization. Apply the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the resume into the appropriate category. Output: The app returns the predicted category (e.g., IT, Marketing, Finance).

Technologies and Tools Used Programming Languages: Python Machine Learning Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Libraries and Frameworks: Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy Natural Language Processing (NLP): Scikit-learn (for text vectorization and implementing the KNN algorithm) Data Source: Pre-collected dataset from Kaggle

Algorithm Used:
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized to classify resumes based on hyperplanes that separate feature vectors into categories.The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing resumes and their respective categories. The SVM algorithm identifies the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy,1.0 (100%)
